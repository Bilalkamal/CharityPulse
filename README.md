# CharityPulse

Welcome to CharityPulse - a dynamic web platform designed to bring transparency and insight into the world of charities. Leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5, CharityPulse is dedicated to providing detailed information about charities using their unique Employer Identification Number (EIN).

This includes basic details like the charity's name, type, and location, as well as more in-depth information such as contact details, social media profiles, and mission statements. Our aim is to aid users in understanding the operations, impact, and authenticity of charities.
